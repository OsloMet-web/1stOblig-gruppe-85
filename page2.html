    <p>Den gamle skolen min var en ny og fin skole, med mange rom å jobbe sammen. Det var kort vei til butikken, og derfor dit vi gikk hver dag. Kantina hadde masse god mat.</p>

    <p>I used to go to a boarding school called Framnes, near Norheimsund. They served us dinner every day. One time, for April Fool's, they served what looked like vanilla pudding for dessert, but it was actually fish pudding dressed with whipped cream. Yum!</p>
